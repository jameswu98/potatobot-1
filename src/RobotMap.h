// For example to map the left and right motors, you could define the
// following variables to use with your drivetrain subsystem.
//const int LEFTMOTOR = 1;
//const int RIGHTMOTOR = 2;

const int Motor_b_Pos = 2;
const int Motor_c_Pos = 3;

// If you are using multiple modules, make sure to define both the port
// number and the module. For example you with a rangefinder:
//const int RANGE_FINDER_PORT = 1;
//const int RANGE_FINDER_MODULE = 1;
